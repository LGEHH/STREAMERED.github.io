<h1 style="color:violet;font-size: 60px;"> <b>WHAT IS STREAMING?</b></h1>
<p style="color:SlateBlue;"><b>The technology of transmitting audio and video files in a continuous flow over a wired or a wireless internet connection. Streaming refers to all media contents(Recorded or
 Live) that are delivered to computers and mobile phones via internet connection
 </b>
 </p>
 <p style="color:SlateBlue;"><b>How can streaming be useful?</b></p>
<p style="color:SlateBlue;">Streaming can be useful in a way that it can make us learn more while watching them, like in cooking streams and other content that the streamer can provide/can think of.</p>

<ul style="color:violet;font-size: 20px;"> Diffirent Platforms on streaming
<li style="color:white;">Twitch - Twitch is a video-streaming platform that offers a fun, social way to watch people play games. Through the Twitch app (and online at Twitch.tv), gamers who broadcast their matches (known as streamers) play their favorite titles while providing running commentary on the action. </li>
<li style="color:white;">FACEBOOK - Facebook is a website which allows users, who sign-up for free profiles, to connect with friends, work colleagues or people they don't know, online. It allows users to share pictures, music, videos, and articles, as well as their own thoughts and opinions with however many people they like. </li>
<li style="color:white;">Youtube - YouTube provides a simple way for people to store videos online and share them with others. YouTube videos cover any topic anyone cares to upload a video about. These videos are easy to share via other forms of social media, email and websites and can also be embedded in other websites.</li>

<p style="color:violet;font-size: 30px;">History of Streaming</p>
<p style="color:violet;font-size: 20px;">1990-2000: Streaming Debuts as a Proof of Concept</p>
<p1>It all starts in the good old nineties. Beanie babies were all the rage, the Macarena was about to go viral, and Gwen Stefani was still punk rock.

Meanwhile, another decidedly less-punk-rock band was making waves in the tech world. I’m talking about Severe Tire Damage, the first live internet band. Just as many famous startups trace their origin to a Silicon Valley garage, so too does Severe Tire Damage. And because the band members had some hook-ups in the tech community, they were the subjects of the first live stream to ever include both audio and video. This was achieved using a technology called MBone. According to one of the band members, the broadcast used up about half of the total available bandwidth for the internet at that time.

The very next year, the Rolling Stones joined Severe tire Damage as live streaming pioneers. And shortly after that, ESPN took advantage of live audio streaming for the Seattle Mariners vs. New York Yankees game.

Some key technologies entered the picture during this decade as well. Forget about MBone, we’re talking the Macromedia (later Adobe) Flash Player, and two streaming protocols that remain relevant today: the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) and the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP).</p1>
<p style="color:violet;font-size: 20px;">2001-2010: The Era of Flash and RTMP</p>
<p1>As bandwidth grew and compression technologies advanced, Adobe Flash became synonymous with video streaming. Meanwhile, RTMP worked behind the scenes as the quarterback.

The concept of internet video also began to play a role in mass media — with streaming services like YouTube, Justin.tv (which would become Twitch), and Netflix taking off. Broadband penetration was increasing and mobile cellular technologies were advancing. Adobe Flash was living its best life, powering 98% of internet browsers.

And then Steve Jobs decided to shake things up.

In his now infamous memo, Thoughts on Flash, the CEO of Apple criticized Flash for being proprietary. He then hammered the nail in the coffin by announcing that the iPhone would not support Flash. Instead, Apple would stream video using its own proprietary format: HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).</p1>
<p style="color:violet;font-size: 20px;">2011-2019: Live Broadcasting Is Brought to the Masses</p>
<p1>Truth be told, Steve Jobs had a point. Moving away from Flash had plenty of benefits. Specifically, HTTP-based technologies outperform the RTMP protocol in terms of both scale and quality. That’s because they allow content distributors to distribute chunk-based adaptive bitrate media files across web servers rather than requiring dedicated streaming servers.

The move to adaptive streaming helped combat buffering and improve caching efficiency in one fell swoop. But, in dethroning RTMP, we were left with a new set of proprietary technologies looking to seize the throne (including Apple HLS, Microsoft Smooth, and Adobe HDS). For that reason, MPEG-DASH was developed in 2012 as an alternative to vendor-specific technologies.

And so, when YouTube moved from Flash to HTML5, it chose DASH as its default protocol. But this introduced a new problem: latency.

Live streaming flourished during the 2010s, as well as video consumption on mobile devices. But so did latency. For instance, when eight million people watched Felix Baumgartner break the sound barrier on YouTube Live, the broadcast actually came with a 20-second delay.  </p1>
<p style="color:violet;font-size: 20px;">2020: COVID-19 Ushers in a Streaming Boom and Flash Dies</p>
<p1>During the first year of the 2020s, live video streaming became ubiquitous. COVID-19 mandated social distancing meant that collaboration and entertainment took place online. It was also the year that Flash died, so broadcasters looked to streaming protocols like Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC), Low-Latency HLS, CMAF for DASH, and Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) to address latency concerns and power interactive content.

Some highlights of the year included the first entirely virtual NFL draft, Nasa and SpaceX’s launch to the International Space Station, and more than 3.3 trillion Zoom meetings.  Use cases like telehealth, digital fitness, and live commerce became second nature to consumers around the world.</p1>
